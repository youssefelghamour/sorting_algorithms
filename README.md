# 0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

This project is meant to be done by groups of two students and involves sorting algorithms and Big O Notation.

## Objectives
- Implement different sorting algorithms
- Understand Big O notation and evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
- Select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
- Recognize stable sorting algorithms

## Files
All programs are written in C:

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `0-bubble_sort.c` | Sorts an array using **Bubble sort** |
| `0-O` | Big O Notations for Bubble sort (best, average, worst cases) |
| `1-insertion_sort_list.c` | Sorts a doubly linked list using **Insertion sort** |
| `1-O` | Big O Notations for Insertion sort (best, average, worst cases) |
| `2-selection_sort.c` | Sorts an array using **Selection sort** |
| `2-O` | Big O Notations for Selection sort (best, average, worst cases) |
| `3-quick_sort.c` | Sorts an array using **Quick sort** |
| `3-O` | Big O Notations for Quick sort (best, average, worst cases) |
