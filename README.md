# 0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

This repository contains the collaborative work of a group project undertaken by two students, Mahmoud Hammam and Youssef El Ghamour, as part of the ALX Software Engineering program. The project focuses on implementing various sorting algorithms and understanding their time complexities, emphasizing hands-on learning and practical application of the concepts taught in the program.

## Objectives
- Implementing different sorting algorithms
- Understanding Big O notation and evaluating the time complexity of an algorithm
- Selecting the best sorting algorithm for a given input
- Recognizing stable sorting algorithms

## Files
All programs are written in C:

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `0-bubble_sort.c` | Sorts an array using **Bubble sort** |
| `0-O` | Big O Notations for Bubble sort (best, average, worst cases) |
| `1-insertion_sort_list.c` | Sorts a doubly linked list using **Insertion sort** |
| `1-O` | Big O Notations for Insertion sort (best, average, worst cases) |
| `2-selection_sort.c` | Sorts an array using **Selection sort** |
| `2-O` | Big O Notations for Selection sort (best, average, worst cases) |
| `3-quick_sort.c` | Sorts an array using **Quick sort** |
| `3-O` | Big O Notations for Quick sort (best, average, worst cases) |
| `100-shell_sort.c` | Sorts an array using **Shell sort** with Knuth sequence |
